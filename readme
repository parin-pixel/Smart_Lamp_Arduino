A sensor which detects objects at a particular range and turns the led ON incase light is below threshhold otherwise led remains off.

components used - hcsr04 sensor, led, resistors, LDR(light dependent resistor), arduino. 

working of hcsr04 sensor - the sensor consists of four terminals - Vcc, trg, echo, gnd. the Vcc is connected to 5v supply and gnd to ground. It consits of a piezo material 
and works on piezo electric effect. when current passed through the piezo material, electrical energy is converted to physical sound waves of frequency 40 kHZ. These signals
when collide with obstacles are reflected back. This is how a sensor detects objects.

working of LDR - it is a resistor whose value changes when light falls on it. electrons in valence band get energized when light of centain frequency falls on it. Hence, it
is free from bound of nucleus and now can conduct electricity. thus resistance drops when light intensity increases.

It is coded in such a way that when ldr reaches a certain value of resistance and object is detected in a particular range by sensor the led turns on for 10s to avoid continous
flickering.
